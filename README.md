# JoinUs-webapp

OVERVIEW
This is a web application using MySQL, node.js, Express, and EJS templates that allows users to "register" using their e-mail address. Registered e-mail addresses are subsequently inserted into a MySQL database, and the user count is refreshed. This application resembles the functionality of a mailing list or an event waitlist.

1. JoinUs/package.json - Contains the dependencies required for this application (MySQL, Express, EJS, Faker, body-parser)
2. JoinUs/app.js - Node.js file containing the framework for the application/e-mail form
3. JoinUs/Public/app.css - CSS Styling Sheet
4. JoinUs/Views/home.ejs - Contains the HTML structure using EJS template
5. JoinUs/node_modules
